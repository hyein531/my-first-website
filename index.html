    <h2>WEB</h2>
    The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling information to be shared over
    the Internet through simplified ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists,[1] as well as
    documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules, the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[2]

    <p>Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by
    programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through
    character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and still very common document type is a web
    page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video
    and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also
    supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web
    surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web
    pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
